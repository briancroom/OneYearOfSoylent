# OneYearOfSoylent
A non-traditionally formatted blog about a guy going a year on soylent (mostly... hopefully.)

###Preamble
My soylent 2.0 arrived last Friday, but I wasn't at the office to retrieve it. I was watching the Jays get their asses handed to them in ALDS Game 2 instead. I got sick over thanksgiving weekend, and because I worked from home this morning I ate a normal breakfast. As a result Day 1 will be tomorrow; on the plus side this gives me a great opportunity to preface what will hopefully be a year long, magical journey.

First a quick word on what I'm doing here, in case you don't know me personally and have stumbled across this little nook of the internet:

My name is Adrian Kemp and my goal is simple - no food outside of soylent for 365 days with as few exceptions as possible. I'll be drinking what I want, including the occasional beer and I'll be chewing gum. When meal time comes around though, it's soylent or nothing.

####Motives

**Money**, holy shit money. Some quick napkin math tells me I spend something around $900 a month on food -- that's on a good month, there's much worse. At a predictable $358 per month, one year of soylent 2.0 stands to save me *at minimum* about $7,000.

**Fitness**, just about exactly five years ago I weighed in at 235lbs and was in really good shape. I liked the way I looked, and I was (indoor) rock climbing five days a week. Best summer of my life, as far as health and energy goes. Now I'm still strong as an ox, and my cardio fitness isn't too bad... but god damn if I haven't gotten fat in the last four years. Right now I weigh about 318lbs and am not at all happy about the way I look, let alone my ability to run around and play sports.

**Social Experiment** Just in thinking about soylent, and the prospect of going 100%, I started realizing how much food dominates my life. Hanging out with friends almost always not just involves, but revolves around, food. Going somewhere new, I'm asking about the food -- and even if I don't ask, it's getting volunteered. So what does it look like if you take that out of the equation? I'm not a social hermit or a single guy living in a bachelor apartment. I spend at least two evenings a week out with friends, and am getting married next year; so what happens when I opt out of the seemingly biggest magnet of social interaction?

####Goals

That's easy: no "normal" food; soylent for every meal of every day. Drinks are wild, and gum is a go.

Exceptions: Anniversary dinner next Sunday, and possibly a christmas celebration with friends that we already began planning last month. If absolutely needed, work related lunches or dinners -- but I will be trying to avoid and/or opt out of these.

Non-exceptions: Family dinners, dinner with friends, and so on. If I'm home celebrating christmas or easter or whatever nonsense I'm there to celebrate that and not eat food. Thankfully Canadian thanksgiving is over and I have a couple of months to explain and prepare people for this. When going out for dinner with friends I'll be pushing for family-style meals where I can have a drink and forgo the food without any awkwardness.
