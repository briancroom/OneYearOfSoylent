###Notes

Soylent 2.0... Damn. Smells, and tastes, a lot like Teddy Grahams I think; this is not a bad thing. Today was fucky so I didn't get to start out properly -- but tomorrow we're doing it! 14th October 2016 will be Day 1.

There's no issue with hunger, but I am already *very* aware of how much food runs my life. Powdered donuts in the breakroom almost caught me on auto pilot, walking through the corner store to grab an energy drink my eyes are darting to the jerky, the chips, chocolate bars, you name it. It occurred to me how often I'll buy that shit just because it's there.
