###Notes

My soylent 2.0 arrived last Friday, but I wasn't at the office to retrieve it. I was watching the Jays get their asses handed to them in ALDS Game 2 instead. I got sick over thanksgiving weekend, and because I worked from home this morning I ate a normal breakfast. As a result Day 1 will be tomorrow; on the plus side this gave me a great opportunity to preface what will hopefully be a year long, magical journey.

Soylent 2.0... Damn. Smells, and tastes, a lot like Teddy Grahams I think; this is not a bad thing. Today was fucky so I didn't get to start out properly -- but tomorrow we're doing it! 14th October 2016 will be Day 1.

There's no issue with hunger, but I am already *very* aware of how much food runs my life. Powdered donuts in the breakroom almost caught me on auto pilot, walking through the corner store to grab an energy drink my eyes are darting to the jerky, the chips, chocolate bars, you name it. It occurred to me how often I'll buy that shit just because it's there.
