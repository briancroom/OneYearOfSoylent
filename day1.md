###Notes

####Morning Check-in

You know how you can eat unhealthy food even when you're full? It doesn't work that way with soylent. 

I didn't get much sleep last night, I had to be at the airport for 07:30. Needless to say I wasn't famished when I awoke at 5:30. Unfortunately unless you're checking bags flying with soylent 2 is a no go, and the only thing I hate more than checking bags is... well lots of things. 

Downing breakfast was not pleasant, though not wholly unwelcome either. I'm sure a greasy sausage mcmuffin would have gone down much easier. 

Anyways I'm fed and on my way, it looks like I'm going to have to do real food for lunch -- I'm not thrilled about that -- but I can live with adding international day trips to the list of exceptions. Hopefully there aren't a lot of those in my near future. 

Still haven't shaken this bug... Flying is probably the worst thing to do today. 

####Afternoon Check-in

Getting hungry, realizing that the convenience of soylent 2 has already completely won me over. Would love to be able to pop a bottle and deal with lunch in 2 minutes flat.

Getting hungry -- that's something I didn't really do that often over the last few years. I'd usually eat because it was time to eat, not because my body actually requested it. Obviously, this was one of the major contributors to my getting fat.

Not really looking forward to my "real" lunch. I actually have always hated eating before a long meeting -- too many times I've had majorfood coma set in, or ate too much without realizing it and been uncomfortable. I might actually be in luck, this is a pretty informal setting and I might be able to just skip lunch without it being weird.
