###Notes

####Morning Check-in

You know how you can eat unhealthy food even when you're full? It doesn't work that way with soylent. 

I didn't get much sleep last night, I had to be at the airport for 07:30. Needless to say I wasn't famished when I awoke at 5:30. Unfortunately unless you're checking bags flying with soylent 2 is a no go, and the only thing I hate more than checking bags is... well lots of things. 

Downing breakfast was not pleasant, though not wholly unwelcome either. I'm sure a greasy sausage mcmuffin would have gone down much easier. 

Anyways I'm fed and on my way, it looks like I'm going to have to do real food for lunch -- I'm not thrilled about that -- but I can live with adding international day trips to the list of exceptions. Hopefully there aren't a lot of those in my near future. 

Still haven't shaken this bug... Flying is probably the worst thing to do today.
