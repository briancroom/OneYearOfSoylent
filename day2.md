####Afternoon Check-in

I only got about 2 hours of sleep last night... not awesome since I got so little the night before too.

Still digging the flavour, still feeling good. I just am really looking forward to a good night's sleep.

Probably because of the sleep schedule stuff, I'm just not consuming very much. I'll be keeping an eye on that.
