###Notes

####Morning Check In

I slept last night, it's the first time since Monday that I've slept more than an hour. I felt like absolute hell when I woke up, but it's fading.

I'm still not hungry... not sure what's going on there. You may be thinking that I'm hungry but just don't want to have soylent -- not the case, I'm surrounded by food and I'm accountable only to myself; I just don't want any of it.

I am still having trouble staying hydrated, I think soylent is a double edged blade when ill; it gives you everything you need to fight it off, but it's even harder to stay hydrated.

I'm debating forcing a meal; but if my body doesn't seem to want food is it really wise to force it?
